\section{Availability} \label{sec:availability}

We make our DNS\footnote{DNSCHK: \texttt{https://tinyurl.com/dnschk-actual}} and
DHT\footnote{DHTCHK: \texttt{https://tinyurl.com/dhtchk-actual}} \SYSTEM{}
implementations available open source for the benefit of the community. Our hope
is that this work motivates further exploration of resource integrity and other
SCA attack mitigation strategies.

We also make publicly available for your consideration part of our evaluation
environment: a patched HotCRP instance\footnote{HotCRP Testbed:
\texttt{https://tinyurl.com/dnschk-hotcrp}}.
