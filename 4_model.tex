\section{Security Goals and Threat Model} \label{sec:model}

The goal of \SYSTEM{} is to ensure the integrity of arbitrary resources
downloaded over the internet, even in the case where the system hosting those
resources is completely compromised. Given a \SYSTEM{}-aware client and a
resource provider with a conforming backend, the user must be automatically
warned whenever what they are downloading does not match a corresponding
authoritative checksum. Given \SYSTEM{} is properly deployed, this must function
without false negatives, \ie{compromised resources that do not trigger a
warning}, or false positives, \ie{benign resources that do trigger a warning}.

Our model considers the following participants: (1) a \SYSTEM{}-aware client as
the \emph{frontend}, (2) a \emph{server} or servers as the distribution system
hosting the \emph{resource}, and (3) a separate high availability system
implementing \SYSTEM{} as the \emph{backend}. Specifically, we consider a
\emph{generic frontend} that might be any web-facing software, such as
FileZilla, and a \emph{browser frontend} such as Google Chrome or Mozilla
Firefox.

When considering a generic frontend, we assume the adversary can make the server
respond to a resource request with any resource, including a compromised version
of a resource. We also assume the adversary can tamper with any other server
response, including adding, removing, or manipulating one or more checksums.

When considering a browser frontend and web server, we assume the user first
navigates to an HTML file (\emph{web page}) on the server. This web page
contains a hyperlink pointing to the resource. The user clicks this hyperlink to
download the resource. This resource is hosted either on the same server as the
web page or externally on a third party server such as a CDN. Both are valid
deployments in the context of \SYSTEM{}. We also assume the adversary can
manipulate the resource and web page wherever they are stored. The adversary
may: (1) compromise the resource, (2) modify the hyperlink to point to a
compromised resource anywhere on the internet, and/or (3) add, remove, or
manipulate any checksums that appear on the web page or elsewhere (excluding the
backend) corresponding to the resource.

Hence, we do not trust the integrity of the server's responses in any scenario.
We do, however, trust the integrity of the backend's responses. Further, we
expect the backend to be highly available. In \secref{evaluation}, we go over
the implications of a compromised backend.

As an aside, we additionally consider the standard non-\SYSTEM{} case where the
resource is co-hosted alongside a web page containing both a hyperlink pointing
to the resource \emph{and an authoritative checksum corresponding to the
resource}. As demonstrated throughout the paper, when the server co-hosting
resources and checksums is compromised, it is trivial to manipulate both
checksum and resource, rendering all forms of checksum verification irrelevant.
Assuming proper deployment, it is the goal of \SYSTEM{} to ensure this is never
the case.
