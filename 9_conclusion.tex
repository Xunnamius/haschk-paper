\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

Downloading resources over the internet is indeed a risky endeavor. Resource
integrity attacks, and Supply Chain Attacks more broadly, are becoming more
frequent and their impact more widely felt. This paper shows that the de facto
standard for addressing resource integrity risk---the use of \emph{checksums}
coupled with a secure transport layer---is an insufficient and often ineffective
solution. We propose a novel practical resource validation approach meant as a
complete replacement for checksum based approaches: \SYSTEM{}, which automates
the tedious parts of verification to eliminate user apathy while leveraging
highly-available authenticated distributed systems to ensure resources and
checksums are not co-hosted. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our approach versus resource integrity attacks in a real-world
system.

The results of our evaluation show that our approach is more effective than
checksums and other attempts at mitigating resource integrity attacks for
arbitrary resources on the internet. Further, we show \DNSSYS{} and \DHTSYS{}
are capable of detecting a wide variety of real-world integrity errors,
significantly raising the bar for the attacker. \DNSSYS{}, as it is backed by
DNS, is deployable at scale for entities that already maintain a web presence;
this can be done without fear of adversely affecting the user experience of
non-compliant clients.
