\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Downloading resources over the internet is a remarkably simple and painless
process for application developers and end users alike. The user (via their
browser) requests a server resource at some URL. The server responds with the
resource. The browser completes downloading the resource. Unfortunately,
downloading content over the internet can be risky.

\TODO{(the rest; an expository summarization of research)}

\TODO{(discuss "free": no interface changes, no addition to resource download
time, no additional burden on the end user (qualified statement))}

In summary, our primary contributions are:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{Improved read performance:} \SYSTEM{} provides decreased read
latencies across all tested filesystems in the majority of benchmarks when
compared to dm-crypt; \eg under F2FS, \SYSTEM{} provides as much as a $2\times$
($1.6\times$ average) speedup over AES-XTS.

  \item \emph{Equivalent write performance:} despite having to maintain more
metadata than FDE schemes based on AES-XTS, \SYSTEM{} achieves near parity or
provides an improvement in observed write latencies in the majority of
benchmarks; \eg under F2FS, \SYSTEM{} provides an average $1.2\times$ speedup
over AES-XTS.

\end{itemize}
