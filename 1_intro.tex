\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Downloading resources over the internet is a remarkably simple and painless
process for application developers and end users alike. The user (via their
browser) requests a server resource at some URL. The server responds with the
resource. The browser completes downloading the resource. Unfortunately,
downloading content over the internet can be risky.

\TODO{(discuss "free": no interface changes, no addition to resource download
time, no additional burden on the end user (qualified statement))}
