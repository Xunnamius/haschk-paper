\section{Evaluation} \label{sec:evaluation}

The primary goal of any DNSCHK implementation is to alert end-users when the
resource they've downloaded is something other than what they were expecting. We
tested the effectiveness of our approach using the DNSCHK extension for Google
Chrome, a real-world deployment of HotCRP, and a random sampling of papers
published in previous \CONFERENCE{} proceedings.
