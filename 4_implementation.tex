\subsection{DNSCHK: Google Chrome Extension}

\TODO{(describe implementation details; works with DNS or DHT and is published
to Chrome store; no interface changes!--i.e. downloads work exactly the same
with or without the extension; users still have to confirm/deny suspicious
judgements, but they're rare occurrences)}

\TODO{(should we provide a link to/description of the hotcrp
demo?)}

    \subsubsection{Expanded Threat Model}

    \TODO{(enumerate additional threats as a table)}

\subsection{DNSCHK: FileZilla (FTP) Patch}

\TODO{(describe implementation details; minor interface change if the download
is judged unsafe or suspicious, requires user to confirm/deny download)}

    \subsubsection{Expanded Threat Model}

    \TODO{(enumerate additional threats as a table)}
