\section{The \SYSTEM{} Approach} \label{sec:approach}

In this section we detail the \SYSTEM{} approach: a novel defense against
receiving corrupted or compromised resources over the internet. The approach
requires no source code or user-facing web server/infrastructure changes in a
browser-based or similar environment, does not employ unreliable heuristics,
does not interfere with other software that also handles download security, and
can be immediately and transparently deployed without breaking clients that do
not implement the \SYSTEM{} approach.

Further, though our concrete implementation relies on DNS and DNS Security
(DNSSEC), the approach itself is flexible and completely agnostic of any single
component. The implementation choice of highly-available distributed backend is
not restricted to the DNS network. The approach works just as well with, for
instance, an authenticated Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) or some distributed
authenticated key-value store (\eg Redis).

\subsection{Proof-of-Concept Implementations}

\TODO{(Google Chrome Extension: describe implementation details; works with DNS
or DHT and is published to Chrome store; no interface changes!--i.e. downloads
work exactly the same with or without the extension; users still have to
confirm/deny suspicious judgements, but they are rare occurrences)}

\TODO{Reference hotcrp demo but leave the description for the evaluation.}

\TODO{(FileZilla (FTP) Patch (only talked about here) describe implementation details; minor interface
change if the download is judged unsafe or suspicious, requires user to
confirm/deny download)}
