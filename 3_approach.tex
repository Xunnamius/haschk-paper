\subsection{Proof-of-Concept Implementations}

\TODO{(Google Chrome Extension: describe implementation details; works with DNS
or DHT and is published to Chrome store; no interface changes!--i.e. downloads
work exactly the same with or without the extension; users still have to
confirm/deny suspicious judgements, but they are rare occurrences)}

\TODO{Reference hotcrp demo but leave the description for the evaluation.}

\TODO{(FileZilla (FTP) Patchdescribe implementation details; minor interface
change if the download is judged unsafe or suspicious, requires user to
confirm/deny download)}
