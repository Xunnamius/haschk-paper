\section{Availability} \label{sec:availability}

We make our DNS\footnote{DNSCHK: \texttt{https://tinyurl.com/dnschk-actual}} and
DHT\footnote{DHTCHK: \texttt{https://tinyurl.com/dhtchk-actual}}
proof-of-concept implementations of HASCHK available to the community open
source so that others can extend it or compare to it. Our hope is that this work
motivates further exploration of resource integrity and other SCA attack
mitigation strategies.

With \DNSSYS{} specifically, we also make publicly available our testing
environment: a patched HotCRP instance\footnote{HotCRP Testbed:
\texttt{https://tinyurl.com/dnschk-hotcrp}}.
