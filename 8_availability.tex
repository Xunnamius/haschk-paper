\section{Availability} \label{sec:availability}

We make our \SYSTEM{} frontend and DHT backend components available open source
for the benefit of the community\footnote{\SYSTEM{} implementation components:
\texttt{https://haschk.dev}}. We also make publicly available our evaluation
environment: a patched HotCRP instance\footnote{\SYSTEM{}'s HotCRP test
environment: \texttt{https://hotcrp.haschk.dev}}. Our hope is that this work
motivates further exploration of resource integrity and other SCA mitigation
strategies.
