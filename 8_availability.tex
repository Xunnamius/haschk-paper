\section{Availability} \label{sec:availability}

We make our \SYSTEM{} frontend\footnote{\SYSTEM{}:
\texttt{https://tinyurl.com/haschk-actual}} and DHT backend\footnote{DHT
Backend: \texttt{https://tinyurl.com/dht-backend-actual}} implementations
available open source for the benefit of the community.  We also make publicly
available our evaluation environment: a patched HotCRP instance\footnote{HotCRP
Environment: \texttt{https://tinyurl.com/haschk-hotcrp}}. Our hope is that this
work motivates further exploration of resource integrity and other SCA
mitigation strategies.
