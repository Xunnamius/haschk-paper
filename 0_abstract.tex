Downloading resources over the internet comes with many risks, including the
chance that the resource has been corrupted, or that an attacker has replaced
your desired resource with a compromised version. The de facto standard for
addressing this risk is the use of \emph{checksums} coupled with a secure
transport layer; users download a resource, compute its checksum, and compare
that with an authoritative checksum. Problems with this approach include (1)
\emph{user apathy}---for most users, calculating and verifying the checksum is
too tedious; and (2) \emph{co-hosting}---an attacker who compromises a resource
can trivially compromise a checksum hosted on the same system. The co-hosting
problem remains despite advancements in tools that automate checksum
verification and generation. In this paper we propose \emph{\SYSTEM{}}, a
resource verification protocol expanding on de facto checksum-based integrity
protections to defeat co-hosting while automating the tedious parts of checksum
verification. We evaluate \SYSTEM{}'s security, practicality, and ease of
deployment by implementing a proof-of-concept Google Chrome
extension. Our implementation is tested versus common resource integrity
violations. We find our approach is more effective than existing mitigation
methods, significantly raises the bar for the attacker, and is deployable at
scale.
