Downloading resources over the internet comes with many risks, including the
chance that a malicious actor has replaced the resource you think you are
accessing with a compromised version. The current standard for addressing this
risk is the use of \emph{checksums} coupled with a secure transport layer; users
download a resource and compare its checksum with a posted checksum from the
developers to ensure a match. Among the many problems with the current use of
checksums are (1) user apathy---for most users, hand-calculating the checksum
and comparing to the published version are too tedious; and (2) co-hosting
resources and checksums---a malicious actor who compromises a resource can
usually trivially compromise a checksum hosted on the same system. In this
paper, we propose \SYSTEM{}, a novel resource validation scheme meant as a
complete replacement for current checksum based approaches. \SYSTEM{} automates
the tedious parts of verification to eliminate user apathy while leveraging
highly-available distributed systems to separate resources from checksums,
making these systems and their end users more resilient to resource integrity
attacks by avoiding co-hosting. We carefully evaluate the security, performance,
and practicality of \SYSTEM{} through implementing extensions in both a web
browser (Chrome) and FTP client (FileZilla); implementations are tested versus
common resource integrity violations. We find that \SYSTEM{} is more effective
than existing solutions, detects a wide variety of real-world integrity errors
across a diverse set of platforms, and is a scalable and immediately deployable
solution.
