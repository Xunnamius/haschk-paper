Downloading resources over the internet comes with considerable risk due to the
general inability of the end user to verify the integrity of the resource
they've received. An adversary could tamper with said resource in a variety of
ways: a) by compromising it en route to its destination, b) by executing a
successful supply chain or similar attack beforehand, or c) by compromising the
server that physically hosts the resource, as was the case with the 2016 breach
of the HTTPS-protected Avast distribution servers that provided downloads of the
popular software suite CCleaner. The de facto standard for addressing this risk
is with the use of \textit{checksums} coupled with some secure transport medium
like TLS/HTTPS. Checksums in this context are digital fingerprints generated by
a cryptographic hashing function, are supposedly hosted on a separate system
than the resource they protect, and are used to verify that resourceâ€™s integrity
to an end user. Checksums are problematic for a whole host of reasons, the
foremost being that the clear majority of end users will not be burdened with
manually calculating the checksum of a resource they've received. Even if they
do, said user must search for the corresponding ``correct'' checksum to verify
their calculation. Managing that, if they recognize the checksums are different,
the user is then expected to ``do the right thing'', whatever that happens to be
in context.

With this research, we explore a novel method of verifying the integrity of
resources downloaded over the internet as a complete replacement for traditional
checksums. We approach the problem with three key concerns in mind: a)
implementations provide security guarantees transparently without adding any
extra burden on the end user, \ie neither grappling with a new user interface
nor any additional labor is required during standard usage; b) configuring the
validation method is simple for service administrators and system operators to
integrate and deploy; and c) no new HTML or JavaScript language additions,
source changes, or . Hence, we propose \SYSTEM{}, a novel automated resource
validation method that is transparent to end users and simple for administrators
to deploy. We implement \SYSTEM{} as a proof-of-concept Google Chrome extension
as well as a patch to the FileZilla FTP client. We evaluate the security,
scalability, and performance of the \SYSTEM{} approach and provide a publicly
accessible demonstration of its utility via a patched HotCRP instance.
