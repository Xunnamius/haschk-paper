\SYSTEM{} acts as a translation layer sitting between the drive and the
operating system. It provides confidentiality and integrity guarantees while
minimizing performance loss due to metadata management overhead. \SYSTEM{}
accomplishes this by leveraging the speed of stream ciphers over the AES block
cipher and taking advantage of the append-mostly nature of Log-structured
Filesystems (LFS) and modern Flash Translation Layers (FTL)~\cite{SSD}.
